Welcome to my personal website. I am a researcher currently interested in the development of novel machine learning algorithms and their applications in robotics. I currently pursuing my PhD in Robot Learning under [Prof Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/21_65.php) at the [ALR Lab](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/index.php), Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology. Before that I was a Data Scientist at the cybersecurity firm McAfee(Intel Security). Previously I worked with Intel for 2 years. I hold a post graduate degree in [Machine Learning and Computing](https://www.iist.ac.in/departments/mathematics-academics) from the [Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology](https://www.iist.ac.in/).
