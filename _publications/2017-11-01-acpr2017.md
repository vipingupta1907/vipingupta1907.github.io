excerpt: 'This paper concentrates on modifying the traditional reconstructive dictionary learning algorithms, by incorporating a discriminative term into the objective function in order to learn class-specific adversarial dictionaries that are good at representing samples of their own class at the same time poor at representing samples belonging to any other class.'
