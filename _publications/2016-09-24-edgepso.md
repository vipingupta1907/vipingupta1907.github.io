excerpt: 'This paper propose a novel approach for solving TSP using PSO, namely edge-PSO by intelligent use of the edge recombination Operator.The approach not only improved the convergence rate but also could produce near optimal solutions, with accuracy better than those obtained from GA even without use of a local search procedure for standard instances from TSPLIB.'

This paper propose a novel approach for solving TSP using PSO, namely edge-PSO by intelligent use of the edge recombination Operator.The approach not only improved the convergence rate but also could produce near optimal solutions, with accuracy better than those obtained from GA even without use of a local search procedure for standard instances from TSPLIB.
